# Hello World! You can call me `Timm`

I am an Open Source Hardware and Circular Economy activist and renewable engergy engineer from Berlin, Germany. 

Sharing knowledge and hands-on skills on #OpenTech  and sustainable transformation is my mission and passion since 2013 when I joined the Open Source Ecology movement. 

Runinng events, talks, workshops and founding initiatives as well as working in the field in South Sudan and Uganda led me to become a trainer and organizer for Open Source Ecology Germany and beyond. 

I started to research and develope methodes for Open Process Documentation and toolboxes like #ASKotec (Access to Skills and Knowledge open tech emergency case) to shape an innovative and #sustainable future on a global scale. 

**I see sharing knowledge as a form of true democracy and empowerment for the future solutions we need.**
